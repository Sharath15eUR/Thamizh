Wifi 6 (802.11ax):
	Suports OFDMA so the channel is divided into multiple narrow bands
and data can be sent parallely.
	Supports MU-MIMO (both uplink and downlink)
	Supports TWT(target wake time)power saving mode
	1024 QAM and so higher data rates
	Improved efficiency
	Supports better security with WPA3
	Works in 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz

Wifi 6E(802.11ax extension):
	Same as wifi 6 and also it supports 6Ghz band
	Wider channels as it allows 160 MHz channels
	Less interference
	Lower latency and high reliability
	
Wifi 7(802.11be):
	Exteremly high efficiency
	320Hz wide channels and so more bandwidth
	4096 QAM
	Multi link operation - a device can simultaneously use multiple bands
	Very low latency
	Supports 2.4,5,6 GHz

Where as Wifi 5 supported only 5Ghz and 80MHz channels and supports MU-MIMO
in only downlink
