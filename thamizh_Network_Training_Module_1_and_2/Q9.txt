Navigate to browser and enter 192.168.1.1 which will redirect you to 
your home router's admin page

Enter the login credentials as mentioned on your backside of the router

Once logged in you should be able to see the available options to control
We can even set firewall to control network traffic

As my router provider didn't give the option to show the list of available
devices, i am using arp scan
