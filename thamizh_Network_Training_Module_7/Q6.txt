When changing the native vlan on a trunk port for a single switch. The native vlan mismatch will
occur and so it will raise error

The command to set native vlan is : switchport trunk native vlan 50

After setting different native VLANs , the ping fails and alsow we get the warning message
showing the different native VLANs. we can rectify it using the same above command and
the ping will work again
