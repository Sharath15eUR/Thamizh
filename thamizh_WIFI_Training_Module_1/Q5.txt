Bridge Mode:
	The bridge mode is used to connect to two wired or wireless
networks. All the devices in the bridge fall under the same network. 
This is useful when we want to conenct two LANs wirelessly. The bridge
will communicate with the main router. So it alows devices on different
networks to communicate by passing traffic between them

Repeater mode:
	The repeater mode is used to enhance the singal coverage of the
exisiting wifi. It receives the signal amplifies it and retransmits it.
Consider we have the wifi router at ground floor and the signal strength
is low at first floor, then we can use a repeater at first floor to enhance
the signal strength without using any wired cables.
