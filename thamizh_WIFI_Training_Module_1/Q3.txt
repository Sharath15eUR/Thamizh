BSS and ESS

BSS :
	Basic Service Set. It's the smallest network of a wifi where there
will be only one AP and all other client devices will connected to this AP.
And the communication can happen only within this network. It is identified
by it BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier). It's range is limited to a single
APs range.
	
	Ex: Home routers, where our laptops and mobile phones are connected
to the single wifi router.


ESS:
	Extended Service Set. It combines multiple BSS under a single
network. Communication can happen between the networks. There can be mutiple
APs and all the APs are connected via a  wired Ethernet. Devices can roam
between different networks without losing the data connection and this is
possible as multiple APs share the same SSID, but each AP has a different
BSSID(MAC address). It offers wider area of coverage.

	Ex: Wifi in large areas such as college campus or office networks. 
As we move through the campus, we can identify the BSSID changing which 
means we are in a ESS network of WiFi.
