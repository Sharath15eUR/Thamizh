To configure a LAN interface using the ip command :

#ip link show : this command will show all the available interfaces along
 with their status and MAC address and MTU etc.

If a interface is down , we can bring it up by using 
 #sudo ip link set wlp1s0 up
Then add a static ip for it
 #sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev wlp1s0
Then add a gateway for it
 #sudo ip route default via 192.168.1.1
