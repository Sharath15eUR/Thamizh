802.11k - radio resource management
	It gives the list of available neighbour APs to which the device
can get connected to during roaming once the devices request a 
neighbour port

802.11v: 
	It gives suggestion to the device to which AP it can roam to so that
it will get better signal and quality coverage

802.11r:
	it enables the fast handover during romaing, by enabling the device
to stay connected while genreating the key for the new AP, and once it
transfers the connection it can again re-verify the new key. SO a lot
of time is saved by using this
