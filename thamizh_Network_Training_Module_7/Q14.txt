Static NAT:
	In static NAT , a public address is assigned to a private IP
address. here i have configured a pc with a switch and a router and finally
a PC1 that acts as external n/w. the router is configured for both
private IP and public IP as per its interfaces along with IP address
for routing.

The ip nat transaltion command is given by ,
	#ip nat inside source static 192.1681.10 200.200.200.10
When we ping the public addres 200.200.200.10, it will be convreted
to the public IP by using the NAT and we will be getting the output

Dynamic NAT:
	The dynamic NAT assigns a public IP from its pool to the 
public IP . it is also called as many to many mapping
	We need to create a pool of ip address along with the subnet
#ip nat pool PUB_POOL 200.200.200.10 200.200.200.20 netmask 255.255.0
Then create a access-list to permit traffic from 192.168.1.0
and then configure the ACL with the dynamic NAT. 
Then ping from pc1 to pc0 and you will get the reply

PAT:
	Port address transaltion (Overloaded NAT) uses a single public IP
to map with multiple private IPs . This is more common in router at home
and office. It follows many to one IP mapping.

	Enable the interfaces by creating public and private. Here also we 
need a ACL to allow the IP address to access the NAT, and after that enable
PAT by
	#ip nat inside source list 1 interface GigabitEthernet0/1 overload
After this, we can ping the pc0 from pc1

To know the IP address change before and after NAT use show nat translations
