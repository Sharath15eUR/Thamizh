Wired Equivalnet privacy (WEP):
	Uses RC4 stream cipher for encryption
	short keys and so very weak
	no proper key management
	easily vulnerable to attacks

WPA (Wifi protected access)
	Introduced TKIP
	Backward compatible with WEP
	stronger than wep but still hackable
	

WPA2 (Wifi protected access 2)
	Uses AES
	it has two modes - WPA2-Personal and (uses PSK authentication)
			- WPA2-Enterprise (uses EAP authentication)
	Very strong

WPA3 (Wifi protected access 3)
	Stronger encryption with AES
	replaced PSK with SAE
	it offers 192-bit encryption
	Also IoT devices can easily connect to it
