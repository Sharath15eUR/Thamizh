fork()
	It is used to create a new process and it is called as child process.
It is an exact copy of the parent process.Once copied both the process can
work independently with different PIDs. It returns a PID of 0 on a successful
creation of child process. Mainly used in paralled processing

Common signals:
	Signals are a way used by OS or user to notify a process that
something has happened. Some of them are
	SIGINT - interrupt
	SIGTERM - termination req.
	SIGKILL - forceful termination
	SIGSEGV - segmentation fault

Kernel crashes:
	When the OS kernel crashes, the system restarts or freezes. This 
happens because of
	Null pointer dereference
	Buffer overlfow
	Driver errors
	Deadlock

Time complexity:
	It describes the execution time of an algorithm with respect to its
input size(n). Some of them are O(n),O(n^2),

Locking mechanism:
	In multithreaded environment, locking mechanism is used to prevent
racing condition(where two threads try to access & modify the same data).
Mutex:
	It blocks the other threads(sleep condition) until the resource is available; it is
used when safety and resource sharing is important;

Spinlock:
	A thread waits in a spinloop (it continuously checks the availability
of lock). It wastes CPU cycles but can be efficient when the wait duration is
shorter.
