EAPOL 4 way handshake - Extensible Authentication Protocol Over LAN

This authentication protocol is used to agree on the encryption after association
by both the client and the AP.

The steps are :
	1. The AP will generate a random number called ANonce and sends it to
client.
	2. The client will generate its own random number called Snonce
(supplicant) and derives PTK (Pairwise transient key) by using the formula,
	PTK = PRF(PMK+Anonce+Snonce+mac addresses), where PMK is already known
to both supplicant and AP during association and PRF is a pseduo random fn. 
The client sends the Snonce along with MIC to the AP.
	The AP can again check the MIC by generating the PTK using snonce
and Anonce.
	
	3. The AP will send GTK(Group transient key) encrypted with PTK
to the client and ask it to use GTK for broadcast and PTK for unicast and ask
the client to install it.

	4. Client sends an EAPOL key frame acknowledging that it has installed
the PTK and GTK. Once the acknowledgement is received, the real data flow
can happen
