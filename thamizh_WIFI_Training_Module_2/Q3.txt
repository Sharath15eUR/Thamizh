CAPWAP in OSI model :
	The CAPWAP protocol fits in the 3rd layer (Network layer) of the 
OSI model, as it mainly transports data packets between AP and WLC.
	Two tunnels:
		Control tunnel
		Data tunnel
Control tunnel :
	It is used to transport the management and contro data between
the AP and WLC such as the WLC joining the AP process. 
It also sends firmware updates to the AP. The UDP port is 5246. 
Encapuslation is done using the DTLS (Datagram transport layer security)

Data tunnel :
	The data tunnel is used to transport client data between AP and WLC.
It also transports the QoS tagged traffic for priority. The UDP port is 
5247. Here encryption is optional but uses CAPWAP headers.
