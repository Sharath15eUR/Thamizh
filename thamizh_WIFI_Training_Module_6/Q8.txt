If a wrong passphrase is entered during the 4-way handshake, the authentication process will fail. 

since the PMK generated by the client will be different from the PMK generated by the AP, the keys they generate for encryption won't match. So


The AP won't be able to verify the client correctly.

The client wonâ€™t be able to validate the AP.

The handshake will fail, and the connection won't be established.
