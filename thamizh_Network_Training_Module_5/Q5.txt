Subnet - used to divide the network into smaller manageable domains,
 
Given IP range  - 192.168.1.0/24 ; this belongs to class C
so the subnet mask would be 255.255.255.0

Task : to divide into 4 subnets

4 = 2^2 ; so we need to borrow 2 bits from the host part. So the total 
network bits is changed to 26.

To find the new subnet mask 

11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000
  255   .  255  . 255     . 192 ---> The new subnet mask is 255.255.255.192

Range for each subnet: 
	(old hosts before borrowing)256-(new hosts after brorrow)192 = 64

So the range for each subnet is 64 and in it 62 hosts are usable as the 
first and last host are resereved for subnet id and broadcast

Subnet name       subnet range 
		(1st -last usable ip)           broadcast

Subnet 1 =  192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.62    192.168.1.63

Subnet 2 =  192.168.1.65 - 192.168.1.126  192.168.1.127

Subnet 3 = 192.168.1.129 - 192.168.1.190  192.168.1.191

Subnet 4 = 192.168.1.193 - 192.168.1.254  192.168.1.255 


Assigning IP to the PC's in cisco packet tracer

	When I tried to connect four different PC's to the router directly,
i got a error as the router had only two gigabitethernet ports. So i tried
the ROAS configuration (Router on a stick) This allows multiple vlans
to be connected the router using a single connection. 

	I configured the switch by creating four vlans and then changed
their switchport mode to access and then i configured the router connected
interface of the switch mode to trunk

	And then i configured the router by creating sub interfaces and 
enabled each sub interface by using the encapsulation dot1Q command. And I
enabled the interface state to UP and after that I pinged the systems
and it worked
