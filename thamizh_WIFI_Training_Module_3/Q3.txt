Modulation:
	It is the process of encoding digital data into radio waves.It
happens at the PHY level and also it is done by modifying the carrier wave
properties like amplitude, phase and frequency

Modulation types:

BPSK	Binary phase shift keying	1 bit/symbol	Low speed

QPSK	Quadrature PSK			2 bits/sym	Medium

16-QAM	16 level Quadrature amplitude	4 bits/sym	Faster 
	modification	

64-QAM	64 levels 			6 bits/sym	Fast

256-QAM	256 level 			8 bits/sym	very fast

1024-QAM  1024 levels			10 bits/sym	Ultra fast

4096-QAM  4096 levels			12 bits/sym	Super fast

QAM :
	So QAM basically works by combining phase and amplitude moudlation.
So consider 64-QAM , each unique combination of amplitude and phase represents
6 bit pattern . So the higher levels of QAM has more bits/symbol and so the
higher data transfer speed. Higher  QAM needs better signal quality so if we
are away from the router , device automatically downgrades to BPSK or QPSK to
maintain connectivity.
