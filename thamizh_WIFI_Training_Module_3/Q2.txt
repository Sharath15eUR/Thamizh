DSSS:
	- Direct sequence spread spectrum
	- It spreads the data over the entire channel frequency by multiplying
it with a pseudo random noise code.
	- Each bit of the data is replaced by a sequence of bits (chips)
	- So it becomes difficult for the hacker to interfere or decode
the signals
	- used in 802.11b wifi standard

FHSS
	- Frequency Hopping spread spectrum
	- It rapidly switches the carrier frequency during transmission
based on a predefined pseudorandom sequence
	- The sequence is known to both the sender and the receiver
	- Provides basic security
	- Its more like talking on a walkie talkie while constantly changing
channels over sync
	- used in 802.11 wifi standard
