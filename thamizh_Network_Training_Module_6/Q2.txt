A small network connection has been made including two pcs and two routers.
The two PCs belong to different subnets

Static Route: The static route is used to forward the packets to a particular destination
in the absence of protocols like BGP/OSPF..

The syntax is : ip route <destination-work> <subnet_mask> <next_hop_IP>

We should configure the router in such a way that, the ip route is set to the next router
Both the routers should be in the same network in order to transmit packets directly

on Router 0 : ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.2

This command basically says that all the packets that are destinated to 192.168.3.0 will be 
redirected to the next hop router of IP 192.168.2.2 ; then from that router it will be
navigated to the corresponding PC.

similary we should configure the router 1 in such a way that all the packets destined to 
192.168.1.0 should be redirected to the next hop router of IP 192.168.2.1

We can check the connectivity using ping and in order to see how the packet is being transmitted
we can use traceroute command. The traceroute command shows the hops taken by the packets to reach
the destination. The screenshots showing the traceroute output has been attached
