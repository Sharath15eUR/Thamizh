OFDM :
	Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
	
	This technique has been used in the wifi standards of Wi-Fi 4 to 
Wi-Fi 7 , includin g 802.11a,g,ac,ax,n.
	
	The older methods such as DSSS occupy the entire channel for a
single message, so there was high chance of intereference, and it was 
not efficient in noisy environments. So the concept of OFDM was introduced

OFDM concept:
	Basically the OFDM divides the available spectrum into many
narrow subcarriers. These subcarriers are orthogonal (mathematically
independent), so there will be no interference between them.And using this
subcarriers we can send parts of the data simultaneously. These sub carriers
are individually modulated with QPSk,BPSK,QAM etc..

Benefits of OFDM:
	High data transfer rate
	Efficient use of bandwidth
	Supports multiple users
	More stable in noisy environments
