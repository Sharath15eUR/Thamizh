ACL- Access control list is used to restrict the incoming and outgoing
traffic in switches and routers. The access list within 100 , means
it will implement rules only with the source IP and the ACL from 100 to 199
will implement rules with source IP , dest IP and source port and dest port

In the config, i created a two PCs, each belonging to different subnet, and
they were conencted to a router and then i enabled the interfaces of the
router and assigned them default gateway as per the corresponding system.

Then i created the ACL list 101 and blocked the http request from pc1 to pc2,

I checked this by opening browser and entering http://192.168.2.10, but it 
responded with request timed out and also the deny rule in ACL hit count
was increases, so ACL blocked the traffic

Router(config)# access-list 101 deny tcp host 192.168.1.10 host 192.168.2.10 eq 80
Router(config)# access-list 101 permit ip any any
Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
Router(config-if)# ip access-group 101 in
Router(config-if)# exit
