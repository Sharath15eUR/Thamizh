When a WLC goes down in a locally connected mode of AP, 
	1. The existing connected devices will be disconnected from the AP, as
all the authentication and encrytption are handled by the WLC.
	2. New devices also cannot be conncted to the AP , as authentication
requires WLC.
	3. The AP will try to reconnect to the the WLC, and once it is 
restored the AP will again connect to the WLC.
	4. If the WLC goes the down, the ongoing communication between the 
AP and the connected devices will be interrupted as the communication 
happens via the CAPWAP tunnel.

	To avoid these , we can connect the AP in flexConnect method, where
the AP will switch to standalone mode if the WLC goes down and enables 
communication within the network thus maintaining the existing devices. We can
also set up a backup WLC to which the AP can be connected if the primary
WLC goes down.
