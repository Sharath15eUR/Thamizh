CAPWAP :
	Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points
	It is a networking protocol used to manage the APs. It enables
communication between AP and WLC.
	It supports split MAC architecture and encryption of data.
	The CAPWAP protocol has two types of packets :
		Control Packets - management data
		Data packets - User data
	The connection between WLC and AP:
		1. AP sends a CAPWAP discovery request (either broadcast
 or DNS resolution or by statically adding the IP of WLC) to WLC
		2. The WLC responds with a discovery response 
		3. The AP will choose a WLC and send the CAPWAP join request
		4. The WLC verify the AP and responds with CAPWAP join response

	WLC manages the APs so if a AP is outdated it sends the firmware update
	It also sends the config details like SSID, security settings
	
CAPWAP Modes:
	1. Local mode : AP forwards all traffic to WLC
	2. FlexConnect mode : When WLC is unreachable , AP switches traffic
locally
	3. Monitor mode : AP only scans for unauthorized devices and interference
