802.1X significantly boosts security in wireless networks by ensuring that only authorized devices can connect and use the network. It provides a more secure way of authenticating users and controlling access to the network, preventing unauthorized devices from gaining access.
802.1X requires that devices authenticate before they can even join the network. This helps ensure that only legitimate users or devices can access the network.
802.1X uses protocols like EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) to securely exchange authentication information, which prevents eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks.
802.1X uses a RADIUS server to centrally manage and verify credentials. This adds an extra layer of security because the server can enforce policies, track whoâ€™s connected, and revoke access if necessary
