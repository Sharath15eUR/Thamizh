802.11r enables fast roaming between APs. The fast BSS transition allows
faster and secure transfer in the connection.

Usually the devices, when try to roam to a new AP they should verify their
key so it takes a long time.

The 802.11r enables the device to negotiate the security keys to the
new AP without being disconnected to the old AP.
So once they shift to new AP they can easily re-verify the key instead of
generating a new one. So the data loss is reduced to a larger extent.
And also the handover is almost fast,secure and invisible.

In mobile:
	Seamless roaming
	almost invisible handoffs
	Energy saving
	Very low latency switching
