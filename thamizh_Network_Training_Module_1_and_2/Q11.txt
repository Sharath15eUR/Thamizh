Connecting to a remote machine using SSH and telnet

SSH : 
	Secure Shell is the recommended way to connect to a remote machine
	as it provides encryption. To connect to a remote machine use,

		$ssh username@remote_ip 
	then enter the password

Telnet:
	Telnet sends every data including password as a plain text so there
	is no encryption. To connect to a remote machine via telent use,
	
		$telnet remote_ip

Note: we can also specify the ports in both kind of connections
