Scanning is the process in which a wireless device searches for the available
WiFi networks. There are two types of scanning
1. active scanning 
2. passive scanning

Active scanning:
	The client sends probe req. on channels and the APs nearby respond to
the probe req. The steps include,
	Client tune to a specific channel
	sends a probe req
	AP respond and make connection
	; active scanning can also find hidden APs and more power consuming
	Faster discovery

Passive scanning:
	client device do not send any frames ; it simply listens for beacon
frames . Beacon frames are broadcasted by the AP every 100ms; slower as it 
has to wait for beacon requests and it is more safer than active scanning
