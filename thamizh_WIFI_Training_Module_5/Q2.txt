OFDMA:
	Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access. It divides the
entire bandwidth into smaller narrow channels so that multiple devices
can transmit data simultaneously. 
	before OFDMA , only one user can send data occupying the entire 
bandwidth, so entire bandwidth cannot be used efficiently.
	
	OFDMA can be useful in crowded places and when we need to small
packets of data. Reduces latency and it divides the bandwidth into
small pieces called resource units and each device can get its own RU
