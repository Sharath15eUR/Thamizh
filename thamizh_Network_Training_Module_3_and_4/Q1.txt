A small network with switch and multiple devices has been created with the
cisco packet tracer. Switch is used to connect devices within the same network

We should statically configure the IP for the two devices and switch operates
at layer 2 , no need for configuring IP for it

After configruing the IP and connecting both the systems to swtich using
ethernet cable , we can ping one pc from the another

At first, the MAC address of the destination PC will not be known, so it will
broadcast a ARP request and finds out the destination PC MAC address

We can see this in the MAC address table of the switch; the command to show is
	show mac address-table
