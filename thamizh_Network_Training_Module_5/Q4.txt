I have released the already assigned IP address using the #sudo dhclient -r command and then
again i asked for a new IP using the #sudo dhclient command;

The DHCP request is divided into 4 ,(DORA process)

DHCP Discovery - the client device sends a broadcast request asking for a IP
DHCP Offer - The DHCP server will offer a IP that is freely available after looking into its
		IP pool and sends it to the client
DHCP Request - The client requests the DHCP server to assign the offered IP address
DHCP Acknowledge - The DHCP server assigns the IP address to client by sending a 
			acknowledgement
