The given ip address : 10.0.0.0/24

It belongs to the class A and its default subnet mask is 255.0.0.0

It has 24 network bits and 8 host bits 

To divide it into 4 equal bits we need to borrow 2 host bits ; so the new subnet mask would be

11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000
  255   . 255    .  2555  . 192    ===> 255.255.255.192(/26)

The number of available hosts , (256-192) is 64 and in this the first and last would be used by
subnet id and the broadcast so we have 62 hosts in each subnet

Subnet name       subnet range
                (1st -last usable ip)           broadcast

Subnet 1 =  10.0.0.1 - 10.0.0.62	      10.0.0.63

Subnet 2 =  10.0.0.65 - 10.0.0.126	      10.0.0.127

Subnet 3 = 10.0.0.129 - 10.0.0.190	      10.0.0.191

Subnet 4 = 10.0.0.193 - 10.0.0.254	      10.0.0.255

The PCs belonging to different subnets can be pinged using the ROAS configuration
