In wireshark i have filtered only the ARP request packets.

ARP - The Address Resolution Protocol is used to map the MAC address with the IP address;
      If a destination IP address is not known , then it will broadcast a ARP request
      asking for the MAC address of destination pc

On Inspecting the ARP request packet, we can see the sender IP address and MAC address but the
destination MAC address will not be known and so it is mentioned as 00:00:00:00:00:00; and
also the type is IPV4

On inspecting the ARP reply packet, we can see the destination MAC address, the type is
also IPV4; this is the ARP reply packet on response to the request
