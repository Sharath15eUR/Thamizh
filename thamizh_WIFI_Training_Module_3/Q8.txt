OFDM :
	Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
	It divides the channel into sub carriers which allows transmission of
parts of data simultaneously.
	Only one device is given access to all the sub carriers for a period of 
time
	Each subcarrier carries a part of data in parallel,increasing
efficiency

OFDMA:
	Orthogonoal Frequency Division Multiple Access
	It also similar to OFDM divides the channel into sub carriers
	It allows multiple users to send data through the sub carriers at the
same time by allocating a group of subcarriers to each user.
	It supports simultaneous uplink/downlink transmission for many
users and has low latency
