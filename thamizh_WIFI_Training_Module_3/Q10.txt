PPDU:
	Physical Protocol Data unit
	it represents the entire PHY frame
	it contains preamble (for synchronization), header (modulation info),
and PSDU (PLCP service data unit).
	it wraps data from MAC layer with necessary headers and preambles
so that receiving device can correctly detect and decode it.

PLCP:
	It is the first layer in PHY , and it acts as a bridge between
MAC layer and the PDU sublayer
	it prepares the data for modulation and transmission
	Converts the MAC layer format into a format that PHY layer can transmit


PMD:
	Physical medium dependent , it is the lowest layer in PHY 
and it is responsible transmitting the data into air and for its reception
	it is responsible for the modulation/demodulation

so the flow is like,

MAC layer
    |
PLCP (add headers & preamble)
    |
PPDU (frame formed and passed to PMD)
    |
PMD (transmission and reception of RF)
