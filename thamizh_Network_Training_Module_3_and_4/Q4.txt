Connect two systems with a swtich and a router; don't forget to assign IP
to the router and enable it

once it is connected, use the ipconfig command to find the ip address of a
pc 

ping the other pc using the ping command and if the ping is success , then
the system is up else it is down

Similarly to check the connectivity and availability of the systems,
we can also use traceroute command ; the command is tracert <ip addr>

If there is any problem in the connectivity we can troubleshoot it by
first checking whether the IP is correct or not and then followed by
checking the connections
