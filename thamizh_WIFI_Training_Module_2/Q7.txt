The best AP mode for a WLC deployed in WAN is FlexConnect mode.
The FlexConnect is best suited because if the WLC is available , it will send
the packets to the WLC and behaves like a normal LWAP, if incase the WLC is 
not available then it will switch to standalone mode 
(Local Switching Mode) where it will allow the
devices to communicate within the n/w without needing a WLC. In the local mode
the AP will configure the SSID authentication and VLAN tagging.

Once the WLC is up, the AP will again establish a connection to the WLC
and then sends the traffic to it. 

By using the Flex connect mode , we can reduce the dependency on WAN and
it ensures uninterrupted Wifi access even if the WAN goes down.

Ex: In a company, devices like printers and computers can communicate
 even if the WAN link to the central WLC is down.
