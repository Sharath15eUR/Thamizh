Guard interval:
	It is the short period of time delay inserted between the data symbols
during transmission. 
	When we transmit data in real time, there is a chance of multipath
propogation i.e. due to bouncing off walls and some other refraction etc..
there are more chances that a part of the symbol may arrive delayed at the 
receiver at the same time where a new symbol might also arrive. This is 
called the Inter-symbol interference problem. The receiver might confuse 
with the symbols. 
	
	So to avoid this , we use Guard interval ; there are
		Short guard interval - 400 ns
		Long guard interval - 800ns.

Long guard interval is more common and more reliable as it has more time before
one symbol completely ends, whereas the short guard interval is more efficient
and does not waste the time but it is being implemented in new devices from 
802.11n.

Because of the shorter GI , more symbols can be transmitted and high throughput
is achieved
