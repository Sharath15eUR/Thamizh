The client association process happens in 3 process,
1. Authentication
2. Association
3. WPA/WPA2 authentication

1. Authentication:
	Two types,
		Open - most modern networks are based on this , they just allow
the client to join the AP and authentication is handled after by WPA
		Shared - the client holds a WEP key which is not secure and
it belongs to old legacy method

2. Association:
	The association is the process where the client gets registered with
the AP. It shares it data rate and also the AP assign the client a Association
ID (AID)

3. WPA/WPA2 authentication:
	once it is registered , a 4 way handshake mechanism will happen
where encryption of keys occurs and only after this real time data will flow
between the client and the AP
