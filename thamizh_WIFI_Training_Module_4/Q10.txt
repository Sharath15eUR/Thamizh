Aggregation technique was introduced mainly to overcome overhead in handling
each frame and combining multiple frames to result in fewer transmissions.

A-MSDU : Aggregated MAC Service data unit
	it combines multiple MSDUs so that a single MAC header can be used for
them and so it is efficient. But if one MSDU is corrupted then we need to
send the entire aggregated frame again as all of them was under a single 
MAC header.

A-MPDU: Aggregated MAC Protocol data unit
	it combines multiple PDUs,but each sub-frame has its own MAC header,
so if one msdu is corrupted then that MSDU alone can be retransmitted.


A-MSDU inside A-MPDU:
	We can aggregate multiple MSDUs into A-MSDU
	and then we can aggregate multiple A-MSDU into A-MPDU
