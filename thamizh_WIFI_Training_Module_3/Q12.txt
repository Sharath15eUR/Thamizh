The data rate is the maximum theoretical transmission speed at the physical
layer between an device and a AP.

Data rate = (no.of data subcarriers)*(number of coded bits per subcarrier per
stream)* (Coding rate)* (no. of spatial streams) / (OFDM symbol duration)+(
guard interval duration)

spatial stream -  1 to 8 in MIMO
