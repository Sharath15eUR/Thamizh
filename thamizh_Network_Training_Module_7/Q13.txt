Creating a extended ACl , requires it to be numbered between 100 and 199,
Using the same setup as Q11, i created a ACL 102 blocking the ftp and http 
port, and assigned it to interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0 and set the bound
to in. 

try making ftp and http requests from pc0 to pc1 , both will be blocked 
because of the ACL.

After checking the ACL matches, the match for both HTTP and FTP has been
increased meaning they are blocked by the ACL

Router(config)#access-list 102 deny tcp 192.168.1.10 0.0.0.0 192.168.2.10 0.0.0.0 eq 80
Router(config)#access-list 102 deny tcp 192.168.1.10 0.0.0.0 192.168.2.10 0.0.0.0 eq ftp
Router(config)#access-list 102 permit ip any any

Router#show access-lists 102
Extended IP access list 102
    deny tcp host 192.168.1.10 host 192.168.2.10 eq www (12 match(es))
    deny tcp host 192.168.1.10 host 192.168.2.10 eq ftp (12 match(es))
    permit ip any any
