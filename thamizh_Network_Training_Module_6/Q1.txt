Using wireshark, i captured the ARP packets; The two packets are
ARP request and ARP reply

On examining the ARP request packets, the source ip address and MAC address
are available in the ARP header of the packet format but the target 
destination MAC address is not known so it will be 00:00:00:00:00:00. We can 
aslo see the ethernet type in the packet

On examining the ARP reply packet, we can get the MAC address of the 
destination PC. We can also see the OP code and frame length,

The ARP request is a broadcast whereas the ARP reply is a unicast.
