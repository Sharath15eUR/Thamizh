MIMO :
	Multiple input and multiple output
	It uses multiple antennas at both transmitter and receiver
	So it transmits multiple data streams to a single device at once.
	Enhances data transfer speed,throughput
	used in 802.11n,ac,ax
	it supports downlink only

MU-MIMO:
	Multi user MIMO
	It is also similar to MIMO but it sends data to multiple devices 
at the same time.
	Wifi 5 supports only downlink and wifi 6 supports both uplink and
downlink
	Optimized for many device environments
