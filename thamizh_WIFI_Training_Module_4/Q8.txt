MAC methodologies:
	
Distributed Coordination fn,
	It is a decentralized method based on "listen before talk",
and it is based on CSMA/CA
	1. device listens the medium for idle time and if the medium is
idle for a specific period of time (DIFS), then it will start a backoff timer 
and once the timer reaches 0, it will transmit the frame and if collision
occurs it will again wait for exponential backoff time

Point Coordination fn,
	Centralized method and AP controls the medium access.
	AP becomes the central coordinator and it will poll each STA
during the CFP(contention free period time) and only the polled STA can
transmit and once the CFP ends the DCF continues again

EDCA:
	Each packet is given a priority, and so different packets have
different back off timer. The packet with high priority will have least
back off timer, so they ger frequent access to the collision medium.
