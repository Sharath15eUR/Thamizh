When two computers in a network share the same IP, there will conflict in 
data transmission and as well as conflict in ARP table

The ARP table keeps on changing the MAC address, as there are duplicate IPs; 
So the data will not be transmitted

Somtimes the router or swtich may share it to any one of the device randomly

Some OS support automatically removing the duplicate IP

Using DHCP , we can solve this as DHCP reassigns a new IP
