The CAPWAP tunnel is maintained between AP and the WLC using regular 
communication. The CAPWAP tunnel is established by,
	1. The AP finds the WLC using DHCP or DNS
	2. AP and WLC exchange CAPWAP packets
	3. if encryption is enabled, the AP and WLC establish a secure 
connection.
	4. The two CAPWAP tunnels (control and Data) are created.

The CAPWAP tunnel is maintained by sending regular updates
	
	1. keep alive messages- The AP sends keep alive messages periodically
to the WLC. If the WLC does not respond , the AP will retransmit the signal
up to a certain period of time and after that it will mark the connection
as closed.
	2. Control messages - The AP sends its configuration updates, status
reports and monitoring data to the WLC. If any change occurs, it will update
dynamically.
	3. DTLS : The AP and the WLC periodically refreshes the key to avoid
hacking attacks
	4.Retransmission : If an AP does not receive ack from the WLC, it
 tries retransmitting the packets and if the conenction is lost , it again
 attempts to connect by using the CAPWAP discovery.
 	5. In case of failure of WLC it switches to the backup WLC.
