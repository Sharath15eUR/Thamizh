LightWeight AP:
	It requires a local WLC to manage multiple APs
	CAPWAP tunnels are used to transfer data between AP and WLC
	Need to add redundant WLC to manage failure
	Scalability is limited as adding a new APs require large WLC
	Managed on-site
	Used in large enterprises
	Security is managed by WLC

Cloud Based AP:
	It doesn't need a WLC , instead they are managed by a centralized 
dashboard
	Data transfer occurs between AP and the internet.
	Data is already distributed and so highly available
	Highly scalable
	Managed remotely
	Used in distributed locations such as branch Offices
	Security is managed by adding firewalls and cloud policies
