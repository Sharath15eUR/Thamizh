MLO - 
	Multi link operation is introduced in WiFi 7 and because of this,
it allows the device to use multiple bands at the same time.

	Earlier , devices can use only one band at the time, either 2.4,5
or 6 Ghz.
	So MLO increases the throughput by enabling transmission across
multiple bands
	better utilization of the available bands,
	Reduced latency and supports load balancing
	Its types are,
		Link aggregation
		Link redundancy
		Link load balancing
		link steering
