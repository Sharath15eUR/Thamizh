Using wireshark i have captured the packets on my wifi adapter. Out of the
captured packets , i have filtered them using a tcp filter with port 443
as it is the port used by modern https

I examined a packet and found out the source IP and destination IP in the IPV4
field and also found the payload in the TCP port. I also found the ethertype 
as IPV4 in the Ethernet II field
