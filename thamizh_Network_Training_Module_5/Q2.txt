ARP - The address resolution protocol is used to map the IP address with the
      MAC address and the rotuer also maintains a ARP table.

ARP spoofing attack - in some cases hacker may send their own PC's MAC 
	address instead of the original one as a reply for the broadcast.
The sender will also assume it as the original mask and will store it in the
ARP table. 

To simulate this, we statically add a ARP entry for the already dynamically
updated ARP entry for a particular IP address. The command is
	#arp -s <ip address> <mac address>

As we have manually added a fake arp entry, now pinging the system will
route the traffic to hackers system instead of the original one.
To avoid this we should enable the dynamic ARP and use encrypted protocols
like HTTPS. However, as the PCs within the cisco packet tracer are limited, 
we couldn't add a static ARP entry
