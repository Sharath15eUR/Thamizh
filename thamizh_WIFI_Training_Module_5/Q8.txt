802.11k - Radio resource management
	It helps the device to find the best available AP quickly.
	Once it is connected to a AP, it requests a neighbour port, 
	The AP will give a list og neighbour APs, so the device no need
to scan now, it already has the list of neighbour APs so that it can connect
to the nearby one as during roaming.
	Less packet loss and huge battery saving

802.11v: wireless network management
	Gives the network ability to suggest a client device to move
to a better AP
	The AP monitors the device health and load
	It sends a BSS transition management request to the client, suggesting
it to move a better AP
	the client device roam based on that 
	Better load balancing

So the 802.11k gives a list of nearby APs to roam and 802.11v suggests to
which AP the device can roam to
