Split MAC architecture :
	It is a network architecture , where the MAC layer functions are divided into two AP and the WLC 
(Wireless Controller)
	Instead of AP handling all the functions (which reduces the efficiency of AP), it is being distributed
between AP and WLC.
	The AP focusses on real-time data such as frame transmission and encryption whereas the WLC 
focusses on authentication and mobility(hand-offs). 
	By implementing this architecture, the load on AP is reduced , so it mainly focusses on wifi traffic.
	The WLC manages the client devices roaming and the hand-offs. This method is useful in large
	enterprises. All the SSID configuration , security policies are handled by the WLC.
