MAC Address table :
	Switch uses the MAC address table for packet transmission.
When we want send packets to a system we know only its IP address but
switch needs MAC address to find the system and so we use the ARP protocol
which is sent as a broadcast asking "Tell. who has IP 192.168.1.10"
	As soon as a Arp protocol is sent, it stores the MAC address 
of the sender in the MAC table and once it gets the ARP reply it stores
the required MAC address too in the table

IP link command : 
	The IP link command is used to show all the available interfaces
along with the important details such as MTU,status and etc.

We can see the mac address table using the ,
  #bridge fdb show


thamizh@thamizh-HP-Pavilion-Laptop-15-eg2xxx:~/Desktop/networking_office/thamizh_Network_Training_Module_3_and_4$ bridge fdb show
01:00:5e:00:00:01 dev wlp1s0 self permanent
01:00:5e:00:00:fb dev wlp1s0 self permanent
33:33:00:00:00:01 dev wlp1s0 self permanent
33:33:ff:63:86:72 dev wlp1s0 self permanent
33:33:00:00:00:fb dev wlp1s0 self permanent


This command shows the MAC address and the device (wifi) using which the mac
address has been learnt;

To manually add a bridge ,
	sudo ip link add bridge br0 type bridge
	sudo ip link set br0 up

Adding interfaces to the bridge,
	sudo ip link set eth0 master br0
	sudo ip link set eth1 master br0

Now the linux machine can work as a bridge
