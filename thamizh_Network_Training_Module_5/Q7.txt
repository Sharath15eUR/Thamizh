I created a small network in the cisco packet trcaer including, two PCs and
a router along with a switch and a server

As the packet tracer cannot directly access the internet, we are simulating
the internet connection by including a server. Here the server acts as 
"google.com" for pinging and also to know how NAT works.

I have configured the router for PAT (Port address translation),by specifying
the inside and outside NAT along with the access list. One interface of the
router is configured with private IP (inside) and the other interface is
configured with public IP(outside) to communicate with the internet. This in
practical cases will be the common IP provided by the ISP to our devices.

So i connected the router with the server by using a copper straight through
cable and configured the server with public IP to mimic google.com

When i pinged the ip address of the server, i was able to get reply from it

The change in IP address can be seen using the command , 
 #show ip nat translations
This shows the NAT table which stores the ip address along with their port.
