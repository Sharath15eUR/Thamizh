The network features two internal PCs configured with private IPs and a NAT enabled router along with a server to depict Google.com
One interface of the router has been enabled with private IP to communicate with the private PCs and another interface of the router
is configured with public IP to communicate with the server. The NAT configurations have been made along with the access-lists.

While configuring the NAT we should enable both the internal and external nat to ease the communication and we can see the change of ip address
by using the NAT table which is available in the router. The type of NAT used here is PAT (Port address translation) which uses single public address
for multiple private IPs by differentiating traffic using the port. So the NAT table stores the IP address along with the port and once it receives
the response from the server, it again forwards it to the respective client.

The change in ip address has also been attached as a screenshot
