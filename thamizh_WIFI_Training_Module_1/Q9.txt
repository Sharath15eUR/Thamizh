Wifi Backhaul :
	it is a network link that is used to connect the APs or routers to
the main internet source. There are multiple types,

Fiber backhaul - uses fiber cable to connect APs - very high speed & low latency
Ethernet backhaul - uses ethernet cable to connect APs - high speed & low latency
Wireless backhaul - uses wireless links to connect APs - low speed & high latency
Cellualar backhaul - uses cellular network to provide internet - Speed and latency vary as per location
Satellite backhaul - uses satellite signals to provide internet - low speed & high latency
Microwave backhaul - uses microwave radio signals to provide internet - medium speed and low latency


After identifying the speed of my wifi and also the connection type of WAN , the
backhaul of my wifi is primarily Fiber and so it uses fiber cable and has high speed
and low latency (the ookla speed test showed only 4ms of latency)
