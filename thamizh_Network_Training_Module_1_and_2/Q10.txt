DHCP

   The DHCP assigns IP addresses automatically to all the devices that join
   in a network using the DORA method

DORA method:
	
	Step 1 : The device which entered the network (without IP) would 
		broadcast a DHCP DISCOVER message to all the devices in the
		network
	Step 2: The DHCP server receives this request and check its IP pool 
		for any available IP; it selects an IP address and sends it
		to the client device by DHCP OFFER message along with IP,
		subnet mask, DNS server, default gateway, lease duration
	Step 3: The client accepts the assigned IP by sending a DHCP REQUEST
		message
	Step 4: The DHCP server acknowledges the request by sending a 
		DHCP ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message to the client

When the lease time is half expired the client again sends a message to the
DHCP server for renewal
