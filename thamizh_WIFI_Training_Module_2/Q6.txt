Sniffer Mode :
	It is a feature in AP, that enables it to capture the WiFi traffic on a
specific channel and sends it to a packet analyzer. Mainly it used in 
enterprises for WiFi troubleshooting, perfomance analysis and network auditing
	The AP acts as a packet capturer and listens to a specific WiFi channel
and then forwards it to a central analysis tool.
	Ex: When a company want to check the latency in their office, 
the IT team will configure a AP to the Sniffer mode and then analyse them using
Wireshark or some other analysis tool.
	
Monitor Mode :
	The WiFi network adapter in the client device works in monitor mode by 
capturing all the WiFi traffic in a particular channel. It will capture 
all the packets which are not intended for it also. The device need not to be
connected to a AP. It can capture broadcast packets also. These packets are
then analysed using wireshark or some other analysis tool.It is mainly used
in penetration testing and to detect Rouge APs.
	Ex: When a company need to check the vulnerability of their
WiFi , then they can use this monitor mode in a client device
