We need a switch and a PC to do the remote access of switch

Create a vlan 99 (named management)  in the switch and assign ip address and subnet mask
by selecting the vlan 99 as interface. Connect the PC to vlan 99 by configuring the 
ethernet port to access mode. 
then enable telnet in the swtich and set password before login

Once done, open the PC and inside command prompt enter, 
#telnet <ip of switch>
and you will get the access of the switch
