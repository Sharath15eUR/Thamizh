WiFi Acesspoint :
	It is a networking device that acts as a bridge between wired and
wireless devices, allowing devices to connect to a wired network.

	There are two types of APs
	integrated AP - found in home wifi router, it consists of router,
switch and AP
	standalone AP - used in companies where multiple APs are used, and
connected via a wired ethernet

Functionalities of AP:
	1. It uses radio waves to communicate with devices
	2. It can opearte in 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz
	3. It converts the wired Ethernet singnal into wireless signals
	4. Implements security protocols like hiding the SSID
	5. Allows multiple devices to be connected to it using protocols like
MIMO(Multiplwe input multiple output- uses multiple antennas at receiver and
transmitter side to enhance data speed)
	6. Acts as a bridge between wired and wireless devices to access the 
wired network. 
	7. If DHCP is found in the AP it can assign IP addresses else it will
forward it to the main router or DHCP server
	8. A WLAN controller is used to control multiple APs in ESS network
	9. The most important function of a AP is load balancing i.e. to 
distribute the devices across multiple APs
