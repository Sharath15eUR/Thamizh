traceroute command is used to trace the path taken by the packet which we sent;

While pining a system if the system is unavailable, we can check where the packet has been
dropped by using the traceroute command ; the traceroute command will show all the hops taken
by the packet

The command in linux/windows is : traceroute <IP> / tracert <IP>
