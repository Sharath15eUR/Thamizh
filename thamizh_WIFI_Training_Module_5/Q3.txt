TWT:
 Target wake time is a power saving mode feature introduced in wifi 6, which
allows most the device to sleep most of the time, so that the battery can be
saved especially for the IoT devices.

	In TWT, both the AP and the client agrees to a specific schedule,
on which the client will wake up and transmit the data and it will be in sleep
mode for the rest of the time. So huge battery savings and improved QoS
in IoT services
