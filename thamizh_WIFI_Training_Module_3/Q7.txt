PHY layer :
	This is the lowest layer in the Wi-Fi stack. This is responsible for
radiating the data into air. It is also called as PPDU - Physical Protocol
Data Unit.

The components of a PHY layer differs based on the generation but the 
general components are,

1. Preamble:
	Used by the receiver to detect and synchronize the incoming signal
	Subfields (802.11a/g/n):
		STF- Short Training field - detect signal timing
		LTF - long  ""        ""  - channel estimation
		Signal field - modulation,coding info

2. Header:
	Carries info about the modulation and coding scheme of frame
	Includes data rate,length of payload,modulation type, coding rate,
GI info.

3. Payload (MPDU-MAC protocol data unit)
	it contains the actual data from MAC layer
	it includes application data, tcp/udp data, MAC headers
