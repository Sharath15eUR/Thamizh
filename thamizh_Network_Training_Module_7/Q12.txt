To create a standard access-list it should be within 100,
and we can imply rules for a specific source IP range.

Consider the same setup as for Q11, two different subnet PCs connected to
router. I created the access-list 5 and allowed traffic from only the
IP range of 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 and denied all other and set it
to interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0 and setbound to IN.

When I pinged the pc1 from pc0 , the ping worked and the acl allow 
match was increased. So the standard ACL works
#Router(config)#access-list 5 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
#Router(config)#access-list 5 deny any 

Router#show access-list 5
Standard IP access list 5
    permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 (4 match(es))
    deny any
