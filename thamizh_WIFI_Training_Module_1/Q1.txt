Wifi operates at both Physical (Layer 1) and Data link layer (Layer 2)

Physical :
	The wifi uses radiowaves to send the data and also uses modulation techniques 
	along with defining the bandwidth and frequencies
	
Data link layer :
	The wifi needs to forwards the data packet between the devices connected across the 
	network and for that it uses the MAC sublayer including the process of 
	data forwarding and addressing
