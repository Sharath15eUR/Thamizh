The Wi-Fi frequency bands are divided into mainly 3 bands,
	2.4 Ghz
	5 Ghz
	6 Ghz


2.4 Ghz:
	- It is used in 802.11 b/g/n/ax
	- It has longer range
	- Penetrates wall better
	- More interference as bluetooth and microwave also use this
	- It has 14 channels and the channel width is 20MHz
	- Out of the 14, 1 6 11 channels can be used without intereference,
as they are the non overlapping channels

5 Ghz:
	- It is used in 802.11 a/ac/ax/n
	- It has faster speed but less range
	- Less intereference
	- The channel width is 20/40/60/80/160 MHz and it has channels 
ranging from 36 to 135
	- It can combine multiple 20 MHz channels to create wider 
channel upto 160 MHz
	- It also uses DFS when needed

6 Ghz:
	- It is used in 802.11 ax,be
	- Faster data rate
	- Very low interference
	- Channel widths are 20/40/80/160/320 and we can have around 59
channels
	- It is accessible only by Wi-Fi 6E/7
