Autonomous AP: They work without WLC and each AP should be configured , maintained
and optimized separately.

If we deploy more than 50 autonomous APs, then we will face the following
issues,
	1. Autonomous APs doesn't support roaming and hand-offs, so there
are high chance of user getting disconnected from the network.
	2. All the APs should configured separately for security, so if even
a single AP was left unconfigured , it will provide access to rogue devices
	3. It is difficult to configure such large number of APs separately
	4. Lacks a centralized dashboard, from where we can configure and 
monitor multiple APs
	5. Autonomous APs doesn't support dynamic load balancing, so 
some APs may get overloaded.
	6. Increased maintanenance and costs as all the devices are handled
separately.
	7. As there is no centralized dashboard, there are high chances that
APs may be deployed with overlapping channels which causes interference and
degrades perfomance.
