Types of Wifi topologies:
	1. Basic Service Set (BSS) - contains one AP and all other devices are connected
to it. Limited coverage and can communicate only within the network
	2. Extended Service Set (ESS) - combines multiple APs via a wired ethernet n/w. The
APs are controlled using a WLAN controller.Can communicate between different networks and 
offers wider area of coverage. Mutliple APs share the same SSID but each AP has different
BSSID
	3. Ad Hoc Mode - also called as Indenpendent Basic service Set (IBSS). No AP, instead
the devices are connected directly to reach other as each device acts as both transmitter and
receiver. No need of router or any other infrastructure for the connection. It is a 
temporary connection. Ex: to share files between two laptops without using internet. Uses 
802.11 Adhoc Mode
	4. Mesh Wifi network - consists of multiple interconnected APs to extend coverage.
It intelligently routes the traffic. Useful in large homes are offices; they use same SSID 
and same network
	5. Wifi Bridge mode - it is used to connect two different wired or wireless networks
All the devices connected to a bridge falls under the same network. Used to connect two LANs
wirelessly.
	6. Wifi Repeater mode - it is used to enhance the signal strength. It receives the 
signal , amplifies it and retransmits it. Mainly used to increase the quality of Wifi
	7.Wifi Direct - No need of wifi setup to transfer data, instead a device acts as a 
small AP and manages conenctions with client; Mainly used for secure file transfer 
(quick share) and wifi print
	8. Hotspot -It's a wireless AP and it provides internet access to the connected devices
 like router, mobilephones
